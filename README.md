# Add, subtract, multiple and divide two Pandas Series.

Write four different functions to return Add, subtract, multiple and division.

Sample Series: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Output:

Add two series:
[3, 7, 11, 15, 19]

Subtract two series:
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Same for multiplication and division.
